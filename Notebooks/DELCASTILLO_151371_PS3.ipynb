7   554 acres   approximately 11 sq   miles   in montana   the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states   another 10   000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia   south america   initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america   p the management team is led by chief executive officer   dr   barry rayment   who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level   dr   rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology   along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry   dr   rayment was the president of bema gold corp       amex   bgo     a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars   he was also affiliated with glamis gold   gold fields mining and amselco exploration   bp minerals     among others   his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward   p among the support team is stephen kay   a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe   south africa   south america and the united states   while with gold fields mining corp     stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california   p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start   up in 1997   for example   delta has discovered the first in   situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite   southeast of lewistown   the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals   a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds   including pyrope   garnet     chromite and clinoprroxene   p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under   explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta   canada   p in bolivia   delta controls approximately two   thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7   860 acres   12 sq miles     the other one   third is presently being explored by de beers   in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2   000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified   p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties   delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration   p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls   they also control a gold property with great potential   the property is near la paz in bolivia   where initial analysis revealed high levels of

what you can do     i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily             i don   t know who joe morris is   but this sounds like a plan     note that     this has been circulating since last thursday                                                                                             united republican fund of illinois     chicago         november 9   2000         from   joseph a   morris   president     to   urf leaders and friends         herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take     in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george     bush   but al gore fails to concede           we all know what is going on in florida   and that the election hinges on     the outcome   i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will     have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does           the recount   which will be finished by 5 p   m   thursday   will likely show     bush to be the winner once again   with only a few thousand overseas     ballots to be counted   those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush   a     minimum of 60   and probably closer to 75     if the count goes our way     tomorrow   we have won this     election           this is when something critical happens   either gore bows out gracefully     or he doesn   t   and i can almost guarantee he won   t   these are people     wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming   they will     use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election     in 1960       when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election     results he didn   t for the sake of the country   expect no such noble     behavior this time             what will they try   one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the     florida results on a flimsy premise   they are already floating this as a     trial balloon in the form of the allegedly   confusing   ballots in palm     beach county   i have seen the ballots   they are not confusing in the     least   indeed   they are identical in form to the punch   card ballots used     in chicago     and cook county   illinois   in this very election   what is more   it is     just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush     inadvertently voted for nader   all parties approved the form of ballot     before the election   the form   of   ballot issue is a mere pretext for an     effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election           while i hope this scenario doesn   t come to pass   i fear that it will       and it will only have disastrous results for the country   the election     fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court   if     this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots     will have been betrayed           personally   i am not going to stand for this   and i hope you won   t     either   the good news is that we are not without voice           here is what must be done   if the vote count affirms bush   s election   we     allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp   if they     have not graciously conceded after a few hours   we must bombard the news     media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of     outrage that demand gore   s concession   i mean literally millions of     phone calls   we must     jam their phone banks with calls   there are millions of us so it     shouldn   t be too difficult     while you   re at it   send e   mails to your     local newspapers as well             if it becomes widely reported   and it will   that there is a     groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country       it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure   he will     have to relent           here are some places to start           the white house   telephone   202   456   4114 fax     202   456   2461 e   mail     president   whitehouse

       " 'introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide   we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products   this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days   please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade   summary of new features multiple children   a   child   product can be the   parent   of another child   multiple links in a chain   and different types of links can be placed against a single parent   static product bar prices   when you change a price in the product bar and hit the       or       button   the price stays   it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout   sorting   you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field   for multiple sorts   hold down your   shift   key   parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified     e   g   the product bar might before have said     basis link   parent   and now would say   stand alone   parent       detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain   for example   child product a can be linked to parent product b   which is in turn linked to parent product c   warning   although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain   system performance is degraded by large chains   this is because when a customer attempts a transaction   the database must   lock   each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request   the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks     vertical   chains   multiple parents and children in one long link   are much slower to process than   flat   chains   one parent with many children     large vertical chains should be avoided   related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent   for example   child product a can have a basis link to parent product b   at the same time   child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b   parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link   static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for   sticky   product bar price and volume changes   when you change a number on the product bar   it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out   this makes it easier to update prices   volumes   spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the       or       buttons   one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements   with the old version of stack manager   if the price delta was too small   traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons   each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth   this makes it harder for customers to transact with us   each time they try   a new price update moves the price   resulting in an increased transaction failure rate   entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer   but larger   price movements are necessary   improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate   you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices   a new field for offset to last trade   this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu   sorting   selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old   you can now choose any field heading   type   location   reference period   etc     and sort by that item   you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key   example   if you select type and then location while holding the shift key   you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type   by location   in alphabetical order     if you right click on the product menu   you can choose from the same sort criteria   plus you can select   sort by web order     which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website   note however   that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing     when you select products   you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always   but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections   this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another   parent products and f   x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed   the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar   to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs     the new version does not show the type of link   this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product   some traders may notice that their products which have f   x links are now identified with a stylised   fx   in the product list   this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent   rather than managed individually   assistance as always   if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality   please

friendly biosphere process system waste   to   energy units in the united states   first unit to roll   out in new orleans in early second quarter   we are expecting earth   shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over   100 million in sales orders in the past year   and tops that record   setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of   8   62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion       our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick     ushg featured at   75 reached 3   65 in 8 days   traded as high as 7   00 since   the biosphere process system   soaring worldwide demand   leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem   this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean   green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste   agricultural wastes   forestry wastes   medical wastes   industrial wastes   sewage sludge   shale oil   sour natural gas   and the huge market of used tires   leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega   watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid   the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost   effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste   leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures   financing of   250 million positions leth for astronomical sales   the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this   1   50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to   8   62 per common share in cash   there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide   the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres   now factor in that the average sale price is   7 million per biosphere   we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential   700   000   000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding   leth stock guidance   current price   1   80 near   term target   4   80 projected high for   04   12   50 leth   s blue chip partner   fortifying the system   leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech   inc     nasdaq   ttek     21   a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental   mechanical   and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of   800 million   tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits   installation   and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth   tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana   this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near   term announcement   political power fosters rapid global expansion   leth has captured the profit   making attention of both us and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources   this has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from dr   albert reynolds   chairman of leth   who is also the former prime minister of ireland   dr   reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding leth into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market   uncommon value for a company of this caliber   we are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere   the impressive backlog of over   100 million in sales orders   and the company   s very solid financial position   we view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company   s own sales records   as our top stock pick for april   we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite

       " 'ngi   s daily gas price index published   october 26   2001 enbridge buys koch   s east texas midstream assets for   231 m enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering   treating   processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for   230   5 million   the package includes all of the east texas system   which gathers 400 mmcf   d for delivery into the carthage hub   enbridge energy company president dan c   tutcher said the assets are a   natural fit   with enbridge   s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company   s   geographic footprint   in the region as well as its energy commodity mix     we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership   s distributable cash flow   and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system       enbridge partners will acquire 1   880 miles of various diameter gathering lines   37 compressor stations   four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf   d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf   d   the transaction is anticipated to close in december   the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase   transportation and resale of natural gas   additionally   when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive   the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas   thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue   the company noted   the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy   it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400   420 mmcf   d in 2002   based on this estimate   the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between   26 million and   32 million for the year   while distributable cash flow would increase by between   0   10 and   0   15 per unit   with further improvements anticipated in 2003   the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50   debt and 50   equity   in line with enbridge partners target long   term capital structure   enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of   6   6 million   or   0   13 per common unit   compared with net income of   14   2 million   or   0   42 per unit   for the third quarter in 2000   the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of   5   4 million   the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process   as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications   third quarter deliveries were 1   208 million b   d compared to 1   272 mmb   d for the same period in the prior year   the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year   to average between 1   30 and 1   33 mmb   d   however   its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil   which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude   for 2002   growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full   year average deliveries to between 1   35 and 1   43 mmb   d     the partnership   s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes   which have languished for the past several quarters   will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002     said tutcher     the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada   we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy   which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income   the partnership   s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders   to that end   we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002      ',\n",

as the supply and market list but i still believe it   s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts   on   4   we use this functionality alot on cgas   tenn   trco and sab       when we path one to many or many to one in   chunks     it does seem to go faster than one path at a time   on   5   brokered paths could really just be slammed in there   no need for the extra processing that occurs for

importance   high all   we   re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed   going foward   i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers   schedulers   we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely   who ever you choose   we would need about 15   of their time for now   later on   with coordination efforts and testing   it may go up to 75     i don   t see that happening for a while though   the sooner we get someone to devote to this   the better off we will be   i expect these changes that we   ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit   that being said   we   ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager   1   currently   the path manager attempts to reuse path ids   i can   t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step   it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn   t find a match   i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can   t think of a valid reason for performing this work   i talked with dave nommensen   and according to him   what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place       from a scheduling perspective   my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it   if you were overpathed   you   d see it in the path manager either way     pinion   richard   to restate the question for clarity   in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply   market and a service   adds any up   downstream contract information and   or duns or drn override and then saves it   unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re   uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id   i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted   has this changed       at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path   activity number match for nominations   texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used   i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur   transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected   therefore   if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify   i don   t think that this constant old path look up is needed     kinsey   lisa   get rid of this   2   the scheduling position window   does anyone use this   if not   we   ll remove the code logic that populates this window   i have never seen a scheduler use this   please verify     pinion   richard   originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system   autonoms   so it was duplicated in unify by request   it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it   s use   the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems   as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers   lose it     kinsey   lisa   why is this still here   3   on the inventory pool list   does anyone need to see the contarct references list   again   this code is called every retrieval time and doesn   t appear to be used from my observations   if they do need this information   we could provide it   but if not   i   d prefer to remove the functionality     pinion   richard   this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool   keep it     kinsey   lisa   yes   we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools   4   when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths   what   s the average number of paths they create at one time   what about updates   i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to   does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records   my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts   by update   i mean   going to the path list and changing an upstream   downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created     pinion   richard   this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline   there is no   average     they typically update a path with up   downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however   i hope this answers your question   i see no change to this process at this time   kinsey   lisa   on some pipes this function is used more than others   when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible   at this time i do not see a need to change this process   5   on brokered paths   do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service   in other words   when updating brokered arrangements   we don   t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated   why do we do this for service   is it because we have to renominate it   i assume that   s what it   s for since we don   t send brokered paths to the pipe   anyway   with the nomlogic implmentation   two way interface     we were planning on having it behave the same way as service   we need this verified     pinion   richard   we don   t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path   i don   t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time     kinsey   lisa   agree with richard  ',\n",

       " 'daren   per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams   apache and our understanding of the agency agreement   i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you   in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled     1   looking at the october gas supply to the plant   i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams   apache   i   e   2   285   and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan   s summary   230   406 at   710   616   70   price of   3   084   if this volume was charged at 2   285 the total would have been   526   477   71   a difference of   184   138   99   2   looking at the november gas supply to the plant   tenaska iv was charged   2   91 per mmbtu   instead of   2   285 for volumes of 267   300   at the   2   91 price   the total settlement price was   777   843 instead of   610   780   50 at 2   285   showing a difference of   167   062   50   i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price   pg   19   for 2000 gas is 2   32   which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha   this adjustment started in 1997 at     03 per mmbtu and increase by 5   per year   thereby currently   the adjustment factor is at   0347   giving us a price of   2   2853 per mmbtu   in reviewing the apache gas agreement   pg   22     i noticed that the gas price is 2   285 at waha   2   315 at katy   carthage for 2000   per review of the apache invoices   it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places   i   e   lomak   sterling   mendell cdp   at a price of   2   175   if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron   however   i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of   2   285   looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october   i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of 45   000 mmbtu per day   therefore i don   t think spot prices are part of the equation here   additionally   i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of     04 per mmbtu   excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct     so based upon items 1   2 above   i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above   therefore   i am planning to wire a payment of   484   234   03   see breakout below   on friday   12   22   to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners   ltd   for this activity   month plant gas price amount november 267   300 2   91   777   843 november adjustment     167   062   50   october adjustment     184   138   99   nov   agency fee 1   350   000   04   54   000 sept   agency fee 98   813   04   3   592   52 total   484   234   03 i discussed these issues with mike mazowita   rick hill   jody pierce before reaching this conclusion   should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering   please call me at 3   7280 and we can discuss   thanks   james',\n",

is considered factory refurbished   a   there are lots of things that can label items factory refurbished   some are so frivolous   its laughable   but because consumer laws prevent manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished as   new     the second consumer gets the best deal   here are a few examples   manufacturers   distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory   country   to avoid   disturbing   the dealer   reseller channel in different countries   manufacturers and distributors cannot export the product   as new and therefore label it as refurb   most major retail superstores offer a 30   day money back guarantee on their products and there are those consumers that just simply take advantage of that   these items are returned to the manufacturer   inspected and repackaged like new   items where the box or casing was damaged in shipment   which are returned to the manufacturer   the item was returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect   the part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer   tested and then repackaged just like new   the item was returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that was corrected   demonstration units are also considered factory refurbished   these units are inspected   tested and repackaged   the box was simply opened   thats it   brand new overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished   all factory refurbished products are inspected serviced by the manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product specifications   all merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer   your one stop distributorjebel ali duty free zonedubai   uae   www   computron   me   com for latest clearance sale listing contact our sales department   for

is a quick status and list of to do   s related to setting up the new j   v   between enron   texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems   summary   the lrc   bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc   ownership in the jv will be split 60   texaco   40   enron   bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j   v   contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted   enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j   v   texaco will be providing the scada system   i understand that accounting is still being discussed   the trading   risk     perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out   trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production   to do   s   accounting   i   ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs   texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks   pc   s   jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc   s for this jv at my request   i will need the work order numbers to track these costs   networks   i   m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21   once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location   a combination of trader phones   lucent phones   stenfons and amtels have been requested   location on eb 21   i   m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv   currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes   there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes   we can   t set up the pc   s   phones   amtels   etc until this is done   data conversion   i have requested from texaco the contract   deal and meter   facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production   it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need   we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios   i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security   i have received the names of the traders but i don   t know who else will need access   interface between enron   s unify pop   s application and bridgeline   s scada application   i   ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface   there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc   s rtu   s   efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system   in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one   this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop   s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete   scada communications   currently the lrc rtu   s   efm communicate back to enron   s scada system via leased lines   bridgelines rtu   s communicate back to them via a microwave system   the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc   s rtu communication to the microwave   perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition   accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes   this data needs to be better defined   i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started   hourly volumes   bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing   we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed   at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer   please let me know if you   d like to meet on any of these topics   i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed   in the mean time i can be reached at 713   853   6858   thanks     tommy',\n",
